# Step-by-Step ProofChain User Guide

## Initial Setup

This section guides you through setting up and starting all components of the ProofChain application (blockchain, backend, and frontend).

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher recommended)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager, usually comes with Node.js)
- **MetaMask** browser extension

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Open **three separate terminal windows**. You will use one for `contracts-hardhat`, one for `backend`, and one for `frontend`.

**In each terminal**, navigate to the respective directory and install dependencies:

**Terminal 1 (contracts-hardhat):**

```bash
cd /home/nishant/proofchain/contracts-hardhat
npm install
```

**Terminal 2 (backend):**

```bash
cd /home/nishant/proofchain/backend
npm install
```

**Terminal 3 (frontend):**

```bash
cd /home/nishant/proofchain/frontend
npm install
```

### Step 2: Create .env Files

For each component, create a `.env` file by copying its `.env.example` counterpart. These files are crucial for configuration and are ignored by Git for security.

**Terminal 1 (contracts-hardhat):**

```bash
cd /home/nishant/proofchain/contracts-hardhat
cp .env.example .env
```

**Terminal 2 (backend):**

```bash
cd /home/nishant/proofchain/backend
cp .env.example .env
```

**Terminal 3 (frontend):**

```bash
cd /home/nishant/proofchain/frontend
cp .env.example .env
```

### Step 3: Start the Hardhat Local Blockchain Node

This node simulates the Ethereum blockchain locally and must be running for the other components to interact with the smart contracts.

**In Terminal 1 (contracts-hardhat):**

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

- **Important:** Keep this terminal open and running. If you close it, the blockchain state will reset, and you'll need to redeploy contracts and reactivate tokens.
- You will see a list of 20 accounts with their private keys. **Note down the private key for `Account #2` (`0x3C44CdDdB6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12FA4293BC`)**. You will need this for MetaMask and for the backend's `DEMO_PRIVATE_KEY`.
- You might see `eth_chainId` and `eth_blockNumber` logs; these are normal and indicate activity.
- If you get an `EADDRINUSE` error, another process is using port `8545`. Find and terminate that process, then try again.

### Step 4: Deploy Smart Contracts and Activate ETH Token

After starting the Hardhat node, you need to deploy your smart contracts and configure the supported tokens.

**In a NEW Terminal Window** (do NOT close Terminal 1 where Hardhat node is running):

1.  Navigate to the `contracts-hardhat` directory:

    ```bash
    cd /home/nishant/proofchain/contracts-hardhat
    ```

2.  **Generate Merkle Root and Proof:**
    We need a Merkle root for the `ProofChainMultiTokenVoting` contract and a Merkle proof for the MetaMask account you'll use.

    ```bash
    npx hardhat run scripts/generateMerkleData.js --network localhost
    ```

    - **Output:** This will print the `Merkle Root` and the `Target Merkle Proof` for `Account #2`. **Copy these values.**

3.  **Update `contracts-hardhat/.env` with Merkle Root:**
    Open `/home/nishant/proofchain/contracts-hardhat/.env` and update the `MERKLE_ROOT` with the value you just copied.

    ```
    # Example for contracts-hardhat/.env
    MERKLE_ROOT=0x55e8063f883b9381398d8fef6fbae371817e8e4808a33a4145b8e3cdd65e3926
    ```

4.  **Deploy `ProofChainMultiTokenVoting` Contract:**

    ```bash
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
    ```

    - **Note the deployed address:** This is your `ProofChainMultiTokenVoting` contract address. It should be `0x9fE46736679d2D9a65F0992F2272dE9f3c7fa6e0`. **Copy this address.**

5.  **Deploy `MockAggregatorV3` (Price Oracle):**

    ```bash
    npx hardhat run scripts/deployMockAggregator.js --network localhost
    ```

    - **Note the deployed address:** This is the address of your mock ETH price oracle. It should be `0xCf7Ed3AccA5a467e9e704C703E8D87F634fB0Fc9`. **Copy this address.**

6.  **Update `contracts-hardhat/.env` with Contract Addresses:**
    Open `/home/nishant/proofchain/contracts-hardhat/.env` and update the `PROOFCHAIN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` and `MOCK_AGGREGATOR_ADDRESS` with the values you just copied.

    ```
    # Example for contracts-hardhat/.env
    PROOFCHAIN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x9fE46736679d2D9a65F0992F2272dE9f3c7fa6e0
    MOCK_AGGREGATOR_ADDRESS=0xCf7Ed3AccA5a467e9e704C703E8D87F634fB0Fc9
    ```

7.  **Activate ETH Token in `ProofChainMultiTokenVoting`:**
    ```bash
    npx hardhat run scripts/activateEthToken.js --network localhost
    ```
    - You should see "ETH token activated successfully!"

### Step 5: Update Environment Variables in Backend and Frontend (Crucial Manual Step)

Now, you need to manually update the `.env` files for your backend and frontend with the correct contract addresses and Merkle proof.

1.  **Update `backend/.env`:**
    Open `/home/nishant/proofchain/backend/.env` and update the following:

    ```
    # Example for backend/.env
    CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x9fE46736679d2D9a65F0992F2272dE9f3c7fa6e0  # From Step 4.4
    DEMO_PRIVATE_KEY=0x5de4111afa1a4b94908f83103eb1f1706367c2e68ca870fc3fb9a804cdab365a # Private Key for Account #2 from Hardhat node startup (Step 3)
    ```

2.  **Update `frontend/.env`:**
    Open `/home/nishant/proofchain/frontend/.env` and update the following:

    ```
    # Example for frontend/.env
    REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x9fE46736679d2D9a65F0992F2272dE9f3c7fa6e0 # From Step 4.4
    REACT_APP_MERKLE_PROOF=["0x070e8db97b197cc0e4a1790c5e6c3667bab32d733db7f815fbe84f5824c7168d"] # From Step 4.2 (ensure it's a JSON string)
    ```

### Step 6: Start the Backend Server

**In Terminal 2 (backend):**

```bash
npm start
```

- If you get an `EADDRINUSE` error, another process is using port `3000`. Find and terminate that process, then try again.

### Step 7: Start the Frontend Development Server

**In Terminal 3 (frontend):**

```bash
npm start
```

- If you get an `EADDRINUSE` error, another process is using port `5003`. Find and terminate that process, then try again.

### Step 8: Configure MetaMask

1.  **Add Hardhat Network to MetaMask:**

    - Open MetaMask.
    - Click the network dropdown (usually "Ethereum Mainnet").
    - Select "Add Network" -> "Add a network manually".
    - Fill in the details:
      - **Network Name:** `Hardhat Localhost`
      - **New RPC URL:** `http://127.0.0.1:8545`
      - **Chain ID:** `31337`
      - **Currency Symbol:** `ETH`
      - **Block Explorer URL (Optional):** Leave blank
    - Click "Save".

2.  **Import Hardhat Account into MetaMask:**
    - In MetaMask, ensure you are on the "Hardhat Localhost" network.
    - Click the circular icon in the top right (your account icon).
    - Select "Import Account".
    - Choose "Private Key" and paste the private key for **Hardhat Account #2** (`0x3C44CdDdB6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12FA4293BC`) from your Hardhat node's initial startup output (Step 3).
      - **Private Key for Account #2:** `0x5de4111afa1a4b94908f83103eb1f1706367c2e68ca870fc3fb9a804cdab365a`
    - Click "Import".

Now, all components should be running, and your MetaMask should be configured to interact with your local development environment. You should be able to commit votes using ETH.
