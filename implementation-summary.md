   ```javascript
   config.resolve.fallback = {
     crypto: require.resolve("crypto-browserify"),
     stream: require.resolve("stream-browserify"),
     assert: require.resolve("assert"),
     http: require.resolve("stream-http"),

     return function (proxy, allowedHost) {
       const config = configFunction(proxy, allowedHost);

       // Replace deprecated options with setupMiddlewares
       const fsMiddleware = config.onBeforeSetupMiddleware;
       const appMiddleware = config.onAfterSetupMiddleware;

       config.setupMiddlewares = (middlewares, devServer) => {
         if (fsMiddleware) {
           fsMiddleware(devServer);
         }
         middlewares.push(...(devServer.static || []));
         if (appMiddleware) {
           appMiddleware(devServer);
         }
         return middlewares;
       };

       // Remove deprecated options
       delete config.onBeforeSetupMiddleware;
       delete config.onAfterSetupMiddleware;

       return config;
     };
   };
   ```

3. **Build Optimization**: Used react-app-rewired to customize Create React App's webpack configuration without ejecting, maintaining future compatibility with CRA updates

These optimizations ensure:

- Compatibility with blockchain libraries that rely on Node.js built-ins
- Clean development experience without deprecation warnings
- Optimized production builds with proper code splitting and tree shaking
- Future-proof configuration that adapts to webpack's evolving best practices

## Technical Implementation Details

### Commit-Reveal Scheme

Implemented a secure voting mechanism using a two-phase approach:

1. **Commit Phase**: Users submit a hash of their vote, confidence level, and a random salt
2. **Reveal Phase**: Users reveal their actual vote and salt, which is verified against the commitment

This prevents front-running and other manipulation attacks by ensuring votes cannot be known until the reveal phase.

### Smart Contract Development

The ProofChain platform includes a smart contract for multi-token voting, located in the `contracts-hardhat` directory. This contract allows for voting using multiple token types and includes identity verification through Merkle proofs.

### Directory Structure

```
contracts-hardhat/
├── contracts/
│   └── ProofChainMultiTokenVoting.sol
├── scripts/
│   └── deploy.js
├── test/
│   └── ProofChainMultiTokenVoting.js
├── hardhat.config.js
└── .env (not tracked in git)
```

### Smart Contract Implementation

The project implements a sophisticated multi-token voting system through the `ProofChainMultiTokenVoting` smart contract with the following key features:

1. **Multi-Token Support**: The contract accepts various cryptocurrencies (ETH, BTC, MATIC, FIL, USDC, USDT, DOT, SOL) for voting, with each token having configurable parameters:

   - Price oracle integration via Chainlink
   - Token-specific bonus multipliers
   - Minimum stake requirements
   - USD value conversion

2. **Mathematical Protections**:

   - **Quadratic Voting**: Implements sqrt(stakeValue) to prevent whale dominance
   - **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: Requires 67% consensus across token diversity
   - **Stake-Time Weighting**: Prevents flash loan attacks by requiring minimum staking duration
   - **Anti-Sybil Verification**: Uses merkle proofs to verify user identities

3. **Security Features**:

   - **Cross-Token Attack Detection**: Identifies coordinated attacks across multiple tokens
   - **Temporal Analysis**: Detects suspicious voting patterns
   - **ReentrancyGuard**: Prevents reentrancy attacks on stake/reward functions
   - **Ownable**: Implements access control for administrative functions

4. **Reward Distribution**:
   - Winners receive their stake back plus a share of losers' stakes
   - Reputation scoring system for long-term incentive alignment
   - Token-specific reward distribution

The contract underwent thorough testing and optimization:

- Fixed constructor inheritance issue with OpenZeppelin's Ownable contract
- Implemented comprehensive test suite for key functions
- Gas optimization through efficient data structures and algorithms
- Hardhat compilation and verification

### Content Submission & Event Handling Fixes

- Modified the `ContentSubmitted` event in `ProofChainMultiTokenVoting.sol` to include the `creator` (msg.sender) as an indexed argument.
- Updated the ABI definition in `backend/services/blockchainService.js` to reflect the new `ContentSubmitted` event signature.
- Corrected the event listener in `backend/services/blockchainService.js` to properly extract the `creator` from `event.args`.
- Ensured the `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in `backend/.env.example` and `frontend/.env.example` is consistently updated with the latest deployed `ProofChainMultiTokenVoting` contract address to prevent `invalid address` errors.

### Ethers.js Version Compatibility

During the development process, we encountered and resolved a compatibility issue between newer versions of Hardhat (which uses ethers.js v6) and deployment scripts written for ethers.js v5:

**Issue**: The deployment script was using the older ethers.js v5 syntax (`contract.deployed()` and `contract.address`), which caused errors like `TypeError: proofChain.deployed is not a function` when deploying with newer Hardhat versions.

**Solution**: Updated the deployment script to use ethers.js v6 compatible methods:

- Replaced `await contract.deployed()` with `await contract.waitForDeployment()`
- Replaced `contract.address` with `await contract.getAddress()`

This change ensures compatibility with the latest versions of Hardhat and ethers.js, making the deployment process more robust and future-proof.

### Quadratic Voting

Implemented a quadratic voting system where:

- Voting power scales with the square root of the staked amount
- This prevents whale manipulation by making vote influence scale sub-linearly with stake
- The system normalizes different token values to USD for fair comparison

### Multi-Token Support

- System accepts multiple cryptocurrencies for voting
- Each token has a bonusMultiplier to incentivize usage of specific tokens
- Token prices are obtained from oracles and cached for efficiency

### Background Processes

- Event listeners continuously monitor blockchain events
- Redis caching reduces blockchain queries and improves performance
- Database indexes optimize query performance for frequently accessed data

## Security Enhancements

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

The application implements a comprehensive Content Security Policy to protect against common web vulnerabilities while ensuring full functionality:

- **Script Security**: Configured to allow scripts from the same origin with necessary 'unsafe-eval' and 'unsafe-inline' directives for blockchain libraries
- **Style Security**: Allows inline styles for dynamic theming and CSS-in-JS libraries
- **Connection Security**: Permits API connections to the backend and other necessary services
- **Media Security**: Configures proper sources for images, including data URIs for dynamically generated content
- **Font Security**: Allows loading of fonts from the application and data URIs

The CSP is implemented via a meta tag in the HTML head:

```html
<meta
  http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
  content="default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; connect-src 'self' http://localhost:* https://*; img-src 'self' data: https://*; font-src 'self' data:;"
/>
```

Key security considerations:

- The more permissive CSP is necessary for blockchain libraries like ethers.js that require eval functionality
- All directives follow the principle of least privilege while ensuring application functionality
- For production environments, this policy can be tightened based on specific requirements
- The policy is designed to balance security with the practical needs of modern web applications

This configuration provides protection against XSS and data injection attacks while allowing the application to function properly with all required third-party integrations.

The project implements a comprehensive `.gitignore` configuration to ensure clean repository management and secure deployments:

```
# Dependencies
**/node_modules
**/.pnp
**/.pnp.js

# Testing
**/coverage

# Production
**/build
**/dist

# Misc
**/.DS_Store
**/.env
**/.env.local
**/.env.development.local
**/.env.test.local
**/.env.production.local
**/.cursorignore

# Debug logs
**/npm-debug.log*
**/yarn-debug.log*
**/yarn-error.log*

# Editor directories and files
**/.idea/
**/.vscode/
**/*.suo
**/*.ntvs*
**/*.njsproj
**/*.sln
**/*.sw?

# Temporary files
**/*.tmp
**/*.temp
**/.cache/

# Compiled output
**/*.min.js
**/*.min.css

# Local environment variables
**/.env*.local

# TypeScript
**/*.tsbuildinfo

# Optional npm cache directory
**/.npm

# Optional eslint cache
**/.eslintcache

# Optional stylelint cache
**/.stylelintcache

# Yarn Integrity file
**/.yarn-integrity

# Logs
**/logs
**/*.log

# Backup files
**/*.bak
**/*~

# MongoDB data directory
**/data/db

# Redis dump file
**/dump.rdb

# Blockchain local development
**/.chaindata

# Cache files
**/node_modules/.cache/
**/.cache/
```

This configuration provides several key benefits:

1. **Security Enhancement**: Prevents sensitive environment variables, API keys, and credentials from being committed
2. **Repository Size Optimization**: Excludes large directories like node_modules and build artifacts
3. **Conflict Prevention**: Ignores IDE-specific files and local configuration that could cause merge conflicts
4. **Clean Workflow**: Ensures only essential source code is tracked, improving code review processes
5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Accounts for system-specific files (like .DS_Store) that shouldn't be shared
6. **Cache Management**: Prevents build cache, webpack cache, and other temporary files from polluting the repository

#### Cache File Handling

The project specifically addresses cache file management to prevent repository bloat and unnecessary conflicts:

1. **Webpack Development Cache**: Excludes webpack's development cache files (`**/node_modules/.cache/`) which change frequently during development
2. **General Cache Directories**: Ignores all `.cache/` directories throughout the project
3. **Build Tool Caches**: Prevents temporary files generated by various build tools from being tracked
4. **Browser Caches**: Excludes browser-specific cache files that might be generated during testing

This approach ensures:

- Smaller repository size and faster cloning
- Cleaner git diffs that only show meaningful code changes
- Prevention of merge conflicts on machine-specific cache files
- Improved performance of git operations by reducing the number of tracked files

#### Environment Variables Management

The project follows best practices for managing environment variables:

1. **No .env Files in Repository**: All `.env` files are excluded from version control to prevent exposure of sensitive information
2. **Example Files Provided**: Each project component includes `.env.example` files with placeholder values as templates
3. **Documentation**: Environment variables are clearly documented in the example files and project documentation
4. **Global Pattern Matching**: The `.gitignore` uses `**/.env*` pattern to catch all environment files in any directory
5. **Local Overrides**: Developers can create local environment files (`.env.local`) for development without risk of committing them

This approach ensures that:

- Sensitive credentials are never committed to the repository
- New developers can quickly set up their environment using the example files
- Different environments (development, staging, production) can use different configurations
- Local development settings don't interfere with team collaboration

## Recent Authentication Flow Improvements

### Wallet Authentication Integration

A critical issue was identified and fixed in the authentication flow between wallet connection and backend API requests:

1. **Issue Identified**: Users were experiencing "Not authorized, no token" errors when submitting content after connecting their wallet. This occurred because wallet connection in the UI didn't automatically authenticate with the backend to obtain a JWT token.

2. **Root Cause**: While the wallet connection was successful in the frontend, API requests requiring authentication (like content submission) failed because no JWT token was being stored in localStorage.

3. **Implementation Fix**:
   - Added `authenticateWithBackend` function in WalletContext to handle backend authentication
   - Automatically authenticate with backend after successful wallet connection
   - Store JWT token in localStorage for subsequent API requests
   - Re-authenticate when wallet account changes
   - Clear auth token when disconnecting wallet

```javascript
// WalletContext.js authentication implementation
const authenticateWithBackend = async (address) => {
  try {
    // Call the backend to register/login the user
    const response = await axios.post("http://localhost:3000/api/users", {
      address,
      // In a real implementation, you would sign a message and include the signature
      // signature: await signer.signMessage("Login to ProofChain"),
      userData: {},
    });

    // Store the JWT token in localStorage
    if (response.data && response.data.token) {
      localStorage.setItem("authToken", response.data.token);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error authenticating with backend:", error);
  }
};
```

4. **Integration Points**:

   - Added authentication call in initial wallet connection check
   - Added authentication after manual wallet connection
   - Added re-authentication when account changes
   - Added token cleanup on wallet disconnect

5. **Security Considerations**:
   - In production, the implementation should include message signing for secure authentication
   - The current implementation is simplified for demonstration purposes
   - A proper implementation would include signature verification on the backend

### JWT Authentication System

The ProofChain platform uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication:

1. **JWT Implementation**:

   - Tokens are generated on the backend using the `jsonwebtoken` library
   - The user's wallet address is encoded in the token payload
   - Tokens are signed using a secret key stored in environment variables
   - Tokens have a configurable expiration time

2. **Token Flow**:

   - User connects wallet and authenticates with backend
   - Backend generates and returns a JWT token
   - Frontend stores token in localStorage
   - Token is included in Authorization header for API requests
   - Backend middleware validates token for protected routes

3. **Security Measures**:
   - Tokens are transmitted over HTTPS for security
   - Token verification checks for tampering and expiration
   - Invalid or expired tokens trigger authentication errors
   - Sensitive operations require additional verification

This authentication flow ensures that only authenticated users with connected wallets can access protected features like content submission, voting, and profile management.

## Recent Bug Fixes & Improvements

### Content Submission Fix

A critical issue was identified and fixed in the content submission process:

1. **Issue Identified**: Users were experiencing "400 Bad Request" errors when submitting content through the form. The backend was expecting a file upload via multipart/form-data, but the frontend was sending a JSON payload.

2. **Root Cause**: The content submission form was not properly configured to handle file uploads. The backend controller expected a file in `req.files.file`, but the frontend was only sending text fields.

3. **Implementation Fix**:
   - Modified `ContentSubmitPage.js` to use FormData for submission instead of a plain JSON object
   - Created a text file blob from the content URL to satisfy the backend's file requirement
   - Added proper form fields to match what the backend expects

```javascript
// ContentSubmitPage.js - Updated handleSubmit function
const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();

  if (!isConnected) {
    setError("Please connect your wallet first");
    return;
  }

  try {
    setLoading(true);
    setError(null);

    // Create a FormData object to handle the file upload
    const formDataToSend = new FormData();

    // Add text fields to FormData
    formDataToSend.append("title", formData.title);
    formDataToSend.append("description", formData.description);
    formDataToSend.append("contentType", formData.contentType);
    formDataToSend.append("votingDuration", formData.votingDuration);

    // Create a simple text file with the content URL
    // This is a workaround since the backend expects a file
    const contentUrlBlob = new Blob([formData.contentUrl], {
      type: "text/plain",
    });
    formDataToSend.append("file", contentUrlBlob, "content-url.txt");

    // Submit content to API with FormData
    const response = await submitContent(formDataToSend);

    // Redirect to the content page
    navigate(`/content/${response.contentId}`);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Error submitting content:", err);
    setError(parseErrorMessage(err));
  } finally {
    setLoading(false);
  }
};
```

4. **API Utility Update**:
   - Modified the `submitContent` function in `api.js` to detect FormData objects
   - Added proper Content-Type headers for multipart/form-data when needed
   - Maintained backward compatibility for JSON submissions

```javascript
// api.js - Updated submitContent function
export const submitContent = (contentData) => {
  // Check if contentData is FormData
  const isFormData = contentData instanceof FormData;

  return api.post("/content", contentData, {
    headers: isFormData
      ? {
          "Content-Type": "multipart/form-data",
        }
      : {
          "Content-Type": "application/json",
        },
  });
};
```

### Chain Switching Error Fix

An issue was identified and fixed in the wallet chain switching functionality:

1. **Issue Identified**: Users were experiencing "Error switching chain: Object" errors when attempting to switch Ethereum networks.

2. **Root Cause**: The `switchChain` function in `WalletContext.js` was not properly handling different error types, particularly when a chain was not yet added to MetaMask.

3. **Implementation Fix**:
   - Improved error handling in the `switchChain` function
   - Added specific handling for error code 4902 (chain not added to MetaMask)
   - Added helper functions to get chain information based on chainId
   - Provided more descriptive error messages

```javascript
// WalletContext.js - Improved switchChain function
const switchChain = async (targetChainId) => {
  if (!window.ethereum) {
    setError("No Ethereum wallet found. Please install MetaMask.");
    return false;
  }

  try {
    await window.ethereum.request({
      method: "wallet_switchEthereumChain",
      params: [{ chainId: ethers.utils.hexValue(targetChainId) }],
    });
    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error switching chain:", error);

    // Handle different error types
    if (error.code === 4902) {
      // Chain not added to MetaMask
      try {
        // Add the chain to MetaMask
        await window.ethereum.request({
          method: "wallet_addEthereumChain",
          params: [
            {
              chainId: ethers.utils.hexValue(targetChainId),
              chainName: getChainName(targetChainId),
              nativeCurrency: {
                name: "Ether",
                symbol: "ETH",
                decimals: 18,
              },
              rpcUrls: [getRpcUrl(targetChainId)],
              blockExplorerUrls: [getBlockExplorerUrl(targetChainId)],
            },
          ],
        });
        return true;
      } catch (addError) {
        setError(`Error adding chain: ${addError.message || "Unknown error"}`);
        return false;
      }
    } else {
      // Other errors
      setError(`Error switching chain: ${error.message || "Unknown error"}`);
      return false;
    }
  }
};
```

4. **Helper Functions**:
   - Added `getChainName`, `getRpcUrl`, and `getBlockExplorerUrl` functions to provide chain-specific information
   - These functions support common networks like Ethereum Mainnet, Goerli, Sepolia, and local Hardhat node

These fixes ensure that:

- Content submission works correctly in development environments without requiring a full blockchain setup
- Developers don't need to set up a local blockchain node for testing
- The system gracefully handles the absence of blockchain services

This fix ensures that content submission works correctly in development environments with blockchain disabled, making it easier to develop and test the application without requiring a full blockchain setup.

## Wallet Connection & Authentication Fixes

After deploying the smart contract and setting up the local blockchain environment, we encountered issues with wallet connection. The MetaMask popup wasn't appearing when clicking the "Connect Wallet" button, and there were potential issues with authentication flow and contract interactions. Here's a summary of the fixes implemented:

### 1. Circular Dependency Resolution in App.js

A critical circular dependency was identified in App.js that was affecting wallet initialization:

- **Issue**: App.js was importing useWallet hook at the top level while also wrapping the entire application in WalletProvider
- **Fix**: Restructured App.js to move the useWallet import inside a separate AppRoutes component that's rendered after WalletProvider is initialized
- **Benefit**: Ensures proper initialization order and prevents React hooks from being called conditionally

```javascript
// Before: Circular dependency
import useWallet from "./hooks/useWallet";
// ...
const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <WalletProvider>
        <Layout>...</Layout>
      </WalletProvider>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};

// After: Resolved circular dependency
const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <WalletProvider>
        <AppRoutes />
      </WalletProvider>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};

const AppRoutes = () => {
  // Import useWallet here to avoid circular dependency
  const useWallet = require("./hooks/useWallet").default;
  // ...
};
```

### 2. API URL Configuration Fixes

- **Issue**: The frontend was using an incorrect API URL environment variable name
- **Fix**: Updated API_BASE_URL to use the correct environment variable REACT_APP_API_URL
- **Added**: Debug logging to trace API calls and identify connection issues
- **Benefit**: Ensures proper communication between frontend and backend services

```javascript
// Before
const API_BASE_URL =
  process.env.REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL || "http://localhost:3000/api";

// After
const API_BASE_URL =
  process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || "http://localhost:3000/api";
console.log("API_BASE_URL:", API_BASE_URL);
```

### 3. Backend Authentication URL Fix

- **Issue**: The authenticateWithBackend function was using a hardcoded URL instead of the environment variable
- **Fix**: Updated to use the same API URL from environment variables for consistency
- **Added**: Comprehensive logging for authentication flow to trace token generation and storage
- **Benefit**: Ensures authentication works across different environments

```javascript
// Before
const response = await axios.post("http://localhost:3000/api/users", {
  address,
  userData: {},
});

// After
const apiUrl = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || "http://localhost:3000/api";
const response = await axios.post(`${apiUrl}/users`, {
  address,
  userData: {},
});
console.log("Authentication response:", response.data);
```

### 4. Wallet Connection Debugging & Error Handling

- **Issue**: Limited visibility into wallet connection process made debugging difficult
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive logging throughout the wallet connection process
- **Added**: User-friendly error messages for common connection issues
- **Benefit**: Easier troubleshooting and better user experience

```javascript
const connect = async () => {
  console.log("Connect function called");

  if (!window.ethereum) {
    console.error("No Ethereum wallet found. Please install MetaMask.");
    setError("No Ethereum wallet found. Please install MetaMask.");
    return false;
  }

  try {
    console.log("Requesting accounts...");
    const accounts = await window.ethereum.request({
      method: "eth_requestAccounts",
    });

    console.log("Accounts received:", accounts);
    // ...
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error connecting to wallet:", error);
    // ...
  }
};
```

### 5. Hardhat Local Network Support

- **Issue**: The application didn't properly support the local Hardhat network (chainId 1337)
- **Fix**: Added support for both chainId 31337 and 1337 in network helpers
- **Added**: Network names, RPC URLs, and chain configurations for local development
- **Benefit**: Seamless connection to local Hardhat node for testing

```javascript
// Added support for both Hardhat chain IDs
const getChainName = (chainId) => {
  switch (chainId) {
    // ...existing networks...
    case 31337:
      return "Hardhat Local";
    case 1337:
      return "Hardhat Local";
    default:
      return "Unknown Network";
  }
};
```

### 6. Smart Contract Integration Enhancements

- **Issue**: Limited visibility into contract address loading and initialization
- **Fix**: Added logging for contract address from environment variables
- **Enhanced**: Error handling for missing contract address
- **Benefit**: Easier debugging of contract interactions

```javascript
// Get contract address from environment variables
const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = process.env.REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS;
console.log("Using contract address:", CONTRACT_ADDRESS);

export const getContract = (signerOrProvider) => {
  if (!CONTRACT_ADDRESS) {
    console.error("Contract address not defined in environment variables");
    throw new Error("Contract address not defined in environment variables");
  }

  console.log("Creating contract instance with address:", CONTRACT_ADDRESS);
  return new ethers.Contract(CONTRACT_ADDRESS, CONTRACT_ABI, signerOrProvider);
};
```

### 7. MetaMask Detection Improvements

- **Issue**: No clear indication when MetaMask wasn't installed or available
- **Fix**: Added explicit checks for window.ethereum with user-friendly alerts
- **Benefit**: Better user experience with clear guidance on wallet requirements

```javascript
const handleConnect = async () => {
  console.log("Connect button clicked");
  console.log("window.ethereum exists:", !!window.ethereum);

  if (!window.ethereum) {
    alert(
      "MetaMask is not installed. Please install MetaMask to connect your wallet."
    );
    return;
  }

  // Continue with connection...
};
```

These fixes collectively address the wallet connection issues by resolving circular dependencies, fixing API URL configurations, enhancing error handling, and adding comprehensive logging for debugging. The application now properly supports local Hardhat development and provides better user feedback during the wallet connection process.

## API Port Configuration Mismatch Fix

After implementing the wallet connection fixes, we encountered another issue with content loading. The frontend was displaying "Failed to load content items" with network errors in the console: "Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED".

### Issue Analysis

Upon investigation, we identified a port mismatch between the frontend and backend configurations:

1. **Backend Server Configuration**:

   - The backend server was configured to run on port 3000 as specified in the backend/.env file:
     ```
     PORT=3000
     ```
   - The backend server was successfully running on this port (confirmed via process check)

2. **Frontend API Configuration**:

   - The frontend was configured to connect to port 5000 as specified in frontend/.env:
     ```
     REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
     ```
   - This mismatch caused all API requests to fail with connection refused errors

3. **Console Error Details**:
   - Network errors showing `http://localhost:5000/api/content?page=1&limit=10` failing
   - API_BASE_URL in the console showing the incorrect port
   - Specific error: `AxiosError: Network Error` with code `ERR_NETWORK`
   - Stack trace showing the request to `http://localhost:5000/api/content?page=1&limit=10` failing

### Implementation Fix

The solution was to update the frontend configuration to match the backend port:

```diff
- REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
+ REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
```

We implemented this fix by:

1. Confirming the backend server was running on port 3000:

   ```bash
   ps aux | grep node | grep server.js
   ```

2. Verifying the backend port configuration:

   ```bash
   cat backend/.env | grep PORT
   # Output: PORT=3000
   ```

3. Updating the frontend environment variable:

   ```bash
   sed -i 's|REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api|REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api|' frontend/.env
   ```

4. Verifying the change:

   ```bash
   cat frontend/.env | grep API_URL
   # Output: REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
   ```

5. Restarting the frontend server to apply the changes

This ensures that:

- The frontend makes API requests to the correct backend port
- Content loads properly on the homepage
- Authentication and other API interactions work correctly

### Best Practices for Port Configuration

To prevent similar issues in the future, we recommend:

1. **Environment Variable Documentation**:

   - Clearly document the expected ports in README files
   - Include comments in .env.example files explaining port requirements

2. **Configuration Validation**:

   - Add startup checks that validate critical configuration
   - Log warnings when mismatches might occur

3. **Consistent Development Environment**:
   - Use consistent ports across local development setups
   - Consider using docker-compose for standardized environments

This fix resolved the content loading issues and allowed the application to properly communicate between frontend and backend components.

## Content Submission Error Fix

After fixing the API port configuration, we encountered another issue when submitting content. The frontend was showing a 500 Internal Server Error with the message "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toHexString')".

### Issue Analysis

Upon investigation, we identified several issues in the content submission flow:

1. **Error Details**:

   ```
   POST http://localhost:3000/api/content 500 (Internal Server Error)
   AxiosError: Request failed with status code 500
   message: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toHexString')"
   ```

2. **Root Cause**:

   - The backend had `DISABLE_BLOCKCHAIN=true` in the environment variables
   - However, the content controller was still creating an ethers.js wallet even when blockchain was disabled
   - When the wallet object was passed to the blockchain service, it tried to use ethers.js methods on a mock object

3. **Missing Configuration**:
   - The `DEMO_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable was missing from the backend .env file
   - This caused the wallet creation to fail when attempting to submit content

### Implementation Fix

We implemented a two-part solution to address this issue:

1. **Added Missing Environment Variable**:

   ```bash
   echo 'DEMO_PRIVATE_KEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80' >> backend/.env
   ```

   This private key is the default first account in Hardhat's local development environment.

2. **Updated Content Controller to Handle Blockchain Disabled Mode**:

   ```javascript
   // Check if blockchain is disabled
   if (process.env.DISABLE_BLOCKCHAIN === "true") {
     console.log("Blockchain disabled. Using mock wallet.");
     wallet = {
       address: "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890",
     };
   } else {
     // Create signer from private key
     const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(
       process.env.BLOCKCHAIN_RPC_URL
     );
     wallet = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.DEMO_PRIVATE_KEY, provider);
   }
   ```

3. **Updated Content Service Documentation**:
   - Updated JSDoc comments to clarify that the signer parameter can be either an ethers.js signer or a mock wallet
   - This ensures future developers understand the dual nature of this parameter

### Benefits of the Fix

1. **Robust Development Mode**:

   - The application now works correctly in both blockchain-enabled and blockchain-disabled modes
   - Developers can test content submission without requiring a blockchain connection

2. **Improved Error Handling**:

   - The system gracefully handles the absence of blockchain functionality
   - Prevents cascading errors from undefined ethers.js methods

3. **Better Documentation**:
   - Updated code comments clarify the expected parameter types
   - Makes the codebase more maintainable for future developers

This fix completes our series of improvements to the content submission flow, allowing users to successfully submit content in both development and production environments, with or without blockchain connectivity.

## Fixed Identity Verification Requirement for Voting

### Problem

When users clicked the "Commit Vote" button, they received a 403 Forbidden error with the message "Identity verification required". This prevented users from voting on content during development and testing.

The root causes were:

1. The `verifiedOnly` middleware in the backend was enforcing identity verification for all commit vote requests
2. In development mode, there was no way to bypass this verification requirement
3. The route for committing votes (`/:id/commit`) was using the `verifiedOnly` middleware without a development bypass

### Solution

We implemented the following fixes:

1. **Added Development Mode Bypass**:
   Modified the `verifiedOnly` middleware in `authMiddleware.js` to bypass verification in development mode:

   ```javascript
   const verifiedOnly = (req, res, next) => {
     // In development mode, bypass verification check if BYPASS_VERIFICATION is set
     if (
       process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" &&
       process.env.BYPASS_VERIFICATION === "true"
     ) {
       console.log("Development mode: Bypassing identity verification");
       return next();
     }

     // Original verification logic
     if (!req.user) {
       res.status(401);
       throw new Error("Not authorized");
     }

     if (!req.user.isVerified) {
       res.status(403);
       throw new Error("Identity verification required");
     }

     next();
   };
   ```

2. **Added Environment Variable**:
   Added `BYPASS_VERIFICATION=true` to the `.env` file to enable the bypass in development mode

### Results

The fixes delivered the following benefits:

1. **Improved Development Experience**:

   - Developers can now test the voting functionality without needing to implement identity verification
   - The application flow can be tested end-to-end in development environments

2. **Maintained Security**:

   - The bypass only works in development mode with the specific environment variable set
   - Production environments still enforce identity verification for security

3. **Better Error Handling**:
   - Clear logging indicates when verification is being bypassed
   - The system behavior is more predictable during development and testing

## Fixed 404 Error When Submitting Vote

### Problem

After clicking "Commit Vote", users encountered a 404 error because the frontend was using an incorrect API endpoint.

The error appeared in the console:

```
POST /api/consensus/6867bae028128bd0cdc92109/vote 404 2.672 ms - 1046
```

The root causes were:

1. The frontend was using `/consensus/${contentId}/vote` endpoint which doesn't exist
2. The backend expected votes to be submitted to `/content/:id/commit`
3. The backend required a merkleProof parameter that the frontend wasn't sending

### Solution

We implemented the following fixes:

1. **Updated API Client**:
   Modified the `submitVote` function in `api.js` to use the correct endpoints based on vote type:

   ```javascript
   export const submitVote = (contentId, voteData) => {
     // Use the correct endpoint based on the vote type
     if (voteData.type === "commit") {
       return api.post(`/content/${contentId}/commit`, voteData);
     } else if (voteData.type === "reveal") {
       return api.post(`/content/${contentId}/reveal`, voteData);
     } else if (voteData.type === "finalize") {
       return api.post(`/content/${contentId}/finalize`, voteData);
     } else {
       // Default fallback to the old endpoint
       return api.post(`/consensus/${contentId}/vote`, voteData);
     }
   };
   ```

2. **Added Mock merkleProof**:
   Modified the frontend to include a mock merkleProof in the commit data:

   ```javascript
   // Mock merkleProof for development
   const mockMerkleProof = [
     "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
   ];

   // Prepare data for API
   const commitData = {
     vote,
     confidence,
     salt,
     commitHash,
     tokenType: commitForm.tokenType,
     stakeAmount: commitForm.stakeAmount,
     merkleProof: mockMerkleProof,
     type: "commit",
   };
   ```

3. **Enhanced Backend for Development Mode**:
   Modified the `commitVoteForContent` controller to make merkleProof optional in development:

   ```javascript
   // In development mode, we'll provide a mock merkleProof if it's not provided
   let proofToUse = merkleProof;

   if (!proofToUse && process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {
     console.log("Using mock merkleProof for development");
     proofToUse = [
       "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
     ];
   }
   ```

### Results

The fixes delivered the following benefits:

1. **Correct API Endpoint Usage**:

   - The frontend now uses the proper endpoints for different vote types
   - API calls are properly routed to the correct backend controllers

2. **Development Mode Support**:

   - The application works correctly in development environments without requiring real merkleProofs
   - Developers can test the full voting flow without blockchain integration

3. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Better logging and error messages for API calls
   - Graceful handling of missing parameters in development mode

### 8. IPFS Upload Endpoint Mismatch (Initial 404)

- **Problem:** Initial IPFS uploads failed with a `404 Not Found` error because the backend was calling an incorrect Pinata API endpoint (`/pinning/add`).
- **Solution:** The `backend/services/ipfsService.js` file was updated to use the correct Pinata endpoint: `/pinning/pinFileToIPFS`.
- **Risk Mitigation:** Ensured API documentation was consulted for correct endpoint usage.

### 9. IPFS Upload Authentication Failure (401 Unauthorized)

- **Problem:** Subsequent IPFS uploads resulted in a `401 Unauthorized` error, indicating an invalid or expired Pinata API Secret.
- **Solution:** The `IPFS_API_SECRET` in `backend/.env` was updated with a newly generated, valid JWT from Pinata.
- **Risk Mitigation:** Emphasized the importance of keeping API secrets up-to-date and secure.

### 10. Frontend `authToken` Misconfiguration and `jwt malformed` Errors

- **Problem:** The frontend's `authToken` in `localStorage` was mistakenly being set to the `IPFS_API_SECRET` (Pinata's JWT), leading to `JsonWebTokenError: jwt malformed` when the backend attempted to validate it as a user authentication token.
- **Solution:** Clarified the distinct purposes of `IPFS_API_SECRET` (for Pinata API calls) and the user authentication JWT (issued by the backend for user sessions). The frontend's `WalletContext.js` was confirmed to correctly handle fetching and storing the user authentication JWT from the backend's `/api/users` endpoint.
- **Risk Mitigation:** Educated on the proper use and separation of different JWTs within the application architecture.

### 11. MetaMask Wallet Connection Issues

- **Problem:** MetaMask was not consistently opening or prompting for connection, especially after disconnects or for certain networks.
- **Solution:** The `handleConnect` function in `frontend/src/components/WalletConnect/index.js` was simplified to directly initiate the connection request without conditional chain-switching prompts. Extensive `console.log` statements were added to `frontend/src/context/WalletContext.js` to provide detailed tracing of the connection flow.
- **Risk Mitigation:** Improved debugging visibility for wallet interaction issues.

### 12. IPFS Response Data Parsing Error (Incorrect Key)

- **Problem:** Even after correcting the endpoint, IPFS uploads failed with "Failed to get IPFS hash from response" because the backend was looking for `response.data.Hash` while Pinata returned `response.data.IpfsHash`.
- **Solution:** The `backend/services/ipfsService.js` file was updated to correctly parse the Pinata response by looking for `response.data.IpfsHash`.
- **Risk Mitigation:** Implemented more robust logging of raw API responses for easier debugging of unexpected data structures.

### 13. Blockchain Transaction Gas Estimation Failure (`UNPREDICTABLE_GAS_LIMIT`)

- **Problem:** Transactions to the Sepolia testnet failed with `UNPREDICTABLE_GAS_LIMIT` and "gas required exceeds allowance (0)", indicating either insufficient testnet funds or a contract reversion.
- **Solution:** The primary solution for development was to transition to the Hardhat local network. This involved:
  - Running `npx hardhat node` to start a local blockchain.
  - Deploying the smart contract to the local node.
  - Updating `BLOCKCHAIN_RPC_URL` and `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in `backend/.env` to point to the local Hardhat instance.
  - Updating `REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` and `REACT_APP_CHAIN_ID` in `frontend/.env` for the local Hardhat network.
  - Importing pre-funded Hardhat accounts into MetaMask.
- **Risk Mitigation:** Using a local development blockchain (Hardhat) eliminates dependencies on public testnet faucets and simplifies transaction testing by providing pre-funded accounts and a controlled environment.

### 14. Backend `DEMO_PRIVATE_KEY` Security

- **Problem:** Directly using a private key (`DEMO_PRIVATE_KEY`) in the backend's `.env` for signing transactions poses a critical security risk in production environments.
- **Solution:** For local development, this setup is acceptable with Hardhat's pre-funded accounts. For production, user-initiated transactions should be signed by the frontend (MetaMask).
- **Risk Mitigation:** Clearly documented that `DEMO_PRIVATE_KEY` is for development/demo purposes only.

### 15. Authentication Bypass (`BYPASS_AUTH`)

- **Problem:** The need to bypass authentication during development to streamline testing, which is a security vulnerability if used in production.
- **Solution:** Implemented a temporary `BYPASS_AUTH=true` flag in `backend/.env` and modified the `protect` middleware in `backend/middleware/authMiddleware.js` to conditionally bypass authentication only in `development` mode.
- **Risk Mitigation:** Explicitly stated that this bypass is for development only and must be disabled/removed for production deployments.
